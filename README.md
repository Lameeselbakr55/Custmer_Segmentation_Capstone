# Custmer_Segmentation_Capstone
using K-means clustering and PCA to perform customer segmentation based on their purchasing behavior in an Online Retail Dataset. 

### In this project:

- K-means clustering and PCA are used to perform customer segmentation based on their purchasing behavior in an an Online Retail Dataset.
- The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers with similar preferences and behaviors, enabling personalized marketing strategies and recommendations.
- Dataset: Online Retail Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
    - Dataset Link: [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)
  
  ### Steps:
    1. Data Preparation:
        - Download the Online Retail Dataset and preprocess it as needed.
        - Calculate some statistics to understand overview about data
        - Handle missing values, Duplicates, clean the data, and transform it into a suitable format for analysis.
        - 
    2. Feature Engineering:
        - Extract relevant features from the dataset that capture customer behavior, such as purchase history, order frequency, total spending, etc.
        - Calculate additional metrics if necessary, such as recency of purchase or average basket size.
        - 
    3. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:
        - Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining the most informative features. This step aims to capture the underlying patterns and structure in the data.
        - 
    4. Determining Optimal Number of Clusters:
        - Use the elbow method and silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means.
        - Experiment with different values of K and evaluate the clustering results.
        - 
    5. K-means Clustering:
        - Perform K-means clustering on the reduced feature space.
        - Assign each customer to a cluster based on their feature values.
        - 
    6. Cluster Profiling:
        - Profile each cluster by calculating cluster-specific metrics, such as average spending, purchase frequency, or popular product categories.
        - Identify the key characteristics and behaviors that distinguish each cluster.
          
    7. Visualization:
        - Visualize the clusters and their separation using scatter plots or other suitable techniques.
        - Plot the clusters based on the reduced feature space to understand the distribution and overlap of customers.
    8. Evaluation:
        - Evaluate the quality of the clustering results using appropriate metrics such as silhouette score or within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).
        - Assess the cohesion and separation of the clusters to determine the effectiveness of the segmentation.
        - 
    9. Personalization and Recommendations:
        - Based on the identified customer segments, develop personalized marketing strategies and recommendations.
        - Tailor promotions, product suggestions, or communication channels for each cluster to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.
          
    10. Interpretation and Insights:
        - Interpret the results and provide insights about the different customer segments.
        - Discuss the implications for the e-commerce business, such as targeted marketing, customer retention, or inventory management.
        - Remember to adhere to ethical guidelines and data privacy regulations while working with customer data.
